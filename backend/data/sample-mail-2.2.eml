Hi,

Hope all=E2=80=99s well. Quick one =E2=80=93 did we close out the payment f=
or *JPMorgan
Chase Facility USD 600MM (Revolver)*? I think the payment for the *Letter
of Credit Fee* (could be around *USD 125,000.00*) was due sometime last
week? I don=E2=80=99t see the confirmation, and I=E2=80=99m wondering if it=
 was processed
or if we missed the cut-off. Also, I was reviewing the last term sheet, and
it mentioned something about *commitment increase*=E2=80=94was that finaliz=
ed or
still pending?

One more thing =E2=80=93 there was a modification notice about *foreign cur=
rency
conversion* for the next tranche. I=E2=80=99m not sure if that=E2=80=99s ef=
fective yet or
if we=E2=80=99re still on the old terms. I remember seeing something about =
a new *deal
ISIN* (but I misplaced it somewhere), so if you have it handy, that would
be helpful.

Oh, and before I forget =E2=80=93 I got a forwarded email from compliance
regarding *duplicate
payments* flagged under this deal. Can you double-check if we=E2=80=99ve ha=
d any
overlap in processing payments for the last 2 cycles? It was flagged
internally, but I want to be sure before escalating.

Let me know when you get a sec.

Cheers,
