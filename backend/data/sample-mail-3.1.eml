*Hey there,*

I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things related to the *Goldman
Sachs Term Loan Facility (USD 250MM Term Loan A).*
=F0=9F=94=B9 *1. Payment Confirmation & Wire Instructions:*

I believe the principal and interest payment for the most recent period
(estimated around *USD 4,850,000.00*, but please verify) was due on or
about *March 15, 2024*. Could you please confirm if the payment has been
processed?

Additionally, can you check if we=E2=80=99re still using the same wire inst=
ructions
for the remittance to *JPMorgan Chase Bank*? The last statement mentioned
possible changes to the account details. Can you confirm if it=E2=80=99s st=
ill:

   -

   *ABA:* 021XXXX89
   -

   *Account No.:* 456XXXX32

------------------------------
=F0=9F=94=B9 *2. Update on Facility Modification & Associated Fees:*

I also recall there was an amendment made recently to this facility that
introduced some *timebound fees*. I=E2=80=99m not sure if those have been b=
illed
yet or if they=E2=80=99re being included in this round. Can you confirm if =
that=E2=80=99s
been factored into the current billing or if it=E2=80=99s pending for the n=
ext
cycle?
------------------------------
=F0=9F=94=B9 *3. CUSIP/ISIN Information Request:*

Lastly, I need the *CUSIP/ISIN* for this facility for some internal
reporting. I remember we had it in one of the previous documents, but I
can=E2=80=99t seem to locate it. Could you share that information when conv=
enient?
------------------------------

Would appreciate a quick update on all these points when you get a moment.

Thanks so much!
