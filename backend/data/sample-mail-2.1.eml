Hey there,

Just wanted to quickly touch base regarding the payment we need to sort out
for the *Morgan Stanley Credit Facility (USD 375MM Revolver)*. I believe
the *principal + interest payment* for the last period (probably around *US=
D
8,725,000.00* but please double-check) was due sometime around the *25th of
Jan 2024*. Not sure if this got processed yet=E2=80=94can you confirm? Also=
, the
remittance should go to the usual account at *Citibank NA*, but I noticed a
note in the last statement about possible updates to the wire instructions.
Can you confirm if we=E2=80=99re still using *ABA 123XXXX45, Account No. 78=
9XXXX10*
or if there=E2=80=99s been a change?

Oh, and by the way, I think there was something about *timebound fees* from
the recent modification to the facility. I can=E2=80=99t remember if they=
=E2=80=99ve been
billed yet or if it=E2=80=99s included in this round=E2=80=94can you confir=
m that part too?

Also, do you happen to have the *CUSIP/ISIN* handy for this facility? I
know it=E2=80=99s somewhere in my notes, but I can=E2=80=99t seem to find i=
t right now.

Would appreciate a quick update on all this when you get a chance.

Thanks,
